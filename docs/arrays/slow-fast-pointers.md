# Slow & Fast Pointers

## Technique
- In a circular track ,30Kmph and 60Kmph cars will meet definitely at some point
- Clue words: "cycle", "circular", "middle node", "happy number"
- s = f = head (2nd Mid); s,f = head, head.next (1st Mid)
- 2 Pointer(winner)

## Template

### Find Middle of Linked List
```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head):
        s = f = head
        while f and f.next:
            f = f.next.next
            s = s.next
        return s
        
```

### Remove Loop
```python
class Solution:
    #Function to remove a loop in the linked list.
    def removeLoop(self, head):
        
        slow = fast = head
        # find cycle
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                break
        else:
            return
        # find 1st node
        slow = head
        while slow != fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        # find tail of cycle (node pointing back to cycle start)
        ptr =slow
        while ptr.next != slow:
            ptr = ptr.next
        ptr.next = None
               
```

## Key Problems
| Problem | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Linked List Cycle | Fast catches slow → cycle |
| Linked List Cycle II | Reset slow to head, move both by 1 |
| Find Middle | Fast reaches end → slow at middle |
| Happy Number | Treat as cycle detection |
| Palindrome Linked List | Find middle → reverse second half → compare |
